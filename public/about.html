      <div>World Cup 2018 Simulator is a fun use of, and example of, using footballsimulationengine the node package module.
      You can find the details to that <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/footballsimulationengine">here</a>.</div>
      <br>
      <div><b>Team and Player Ratings:</b><br>
      Team ratings are determined by taking FIFA team scores and dividing them by a common number.
      Player rankings are randomly generated based on that FIFA team score. There's some extra logic for specific positions, star players etc.</div>
      <br>
      <div><b>How to Play:</b><br>
      Select your Country<br>
      Select your team(s)<br>
      Quick Match or Watch Match to see results</div>
<br>
      <div><b>Hosting:</b><br>
      This project is hosted on IBM Cloud. As an IBM employee it makes sense for me to champion my own companies product.
      The development is easy to do and easy to update. There is limited 'lite' hosting for node applications which I'm using here.
<br>
      <b>Note: </b>This is not an IBM endorsed, supported or responsible simulator. It is created entirely in a personal capacity.</div>
